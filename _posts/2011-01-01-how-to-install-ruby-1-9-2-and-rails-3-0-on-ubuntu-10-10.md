If you are newbie on linux you might run into the same problem I had. I tried to install ruby and then ruby on rails by compiling source code of ruby and then just try gem install rails. Everything worked until I tried that command. I was getting that awful `no such file to load zlib` error - hey I'm still newbie I have no idea what that is! :)

So many hours later I found solution, both as a wall of text and as a screen cast!

After all that compiling I tried installing and following bunch of articles which led up to a point that I had to(only in my head) re-install Ubuntu...

So that's what I did! :)

With fresh Ubuntu 10.10 installed I went straight back to page which was given to me in #rubyonrails irc channel by some random(for me) cool dude. In comments I found a link to a screen cast of the same thing, so enjoy:

1.  Wall of text version - [http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you](http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you)
2.  Screen cast version - [http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-install-ruby-1-9-2-and-rails-3-0-on-ubuntu-10-10-4148.html](http://www.rubyinside.com/how-to-install-ruby-1-9-2-and-rails-3-0-on-ubuntu-10-10-4148.html)

I ended up following screen cast version and it worked!

Big thanks and love for both of those articles! <3

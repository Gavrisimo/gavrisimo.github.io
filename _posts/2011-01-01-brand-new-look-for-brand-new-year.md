Is there a better way to start new year then to install excellent and *free* WordPress theme?!?

Thanks WooThemes!

After resolving my ruby and ruby on rails issues I was having entire day on my Ubuntu 10.10, which was resolved by re-installing Ubuntu, I decided that I'm either going to find some amazing theme for WordPress or I'm going to delete WordPress and put some `portfolio.html` file...

So after maybe an hour or so I finally found this theme called *Irresistible* and I just love it!

This theme was created by good folks at [woothemes.com](http://www.woothemes.com/) and you can download it here: [http://www.woothemes.com/2009/02/irresistible/](http://www.woothemes.com/2009/02/irresistible/)
